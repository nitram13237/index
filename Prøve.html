<h3> At the very least, tea is a flavourful way of getting enough fluid into your body each day. On top of that, studies have shown teas can help protect your teeth and your heart   </h3> 
<h2> INGREDIENTS  </h2>
<h3  <ol> 
     <li> Tea bag </li>
     <li> Water </li>
     <li> Milk-Dair/plant-based (Optional) </li>
     <li> Suger/Honey (optinal) </li> </ol> </h3>

<h2>            PEPARATION  </h2>     
<h3>1. Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aerated, and
    only boil it once to keep the oxygen level up. Oxeygen
    in water helps flavour!
2. Pop a tea bag into your mug (always a big mug)
3. Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir brifly.
4. Tea needs time to unlock all its flayvour, so give it 3-4
   minutes to do its thing. This is a perfect time to grab a
   sneacky cookie or daydream about vacations.
5. Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a
   spoon against the side of the mug. Not too much or
   you will make it bitter.
6. if you want, throw in some milk or sugar or huney or nothing else at all.
7. Enjoy! </h3>
